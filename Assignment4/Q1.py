"""What is File function in python? What is keywords to create and write
file.

Ans - In Python, file operations are primarily managed using the built-in open() 
function, which allows you to create, read, or write files.

'w': Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it is overwritten; if not, a new file is created.
'a': Opens a file for appending. Data written will be added at the end of the file.
'x': Opens a file for exclusive creation. The operation fails if the file already exists.
