# Q-18 What is tuple? Differnce between tuple and list.

"""
Ans:
Tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items in Python. It can store multiple items, 
similar to a list, but once a tuple is created,  you can't add, remove, or change elements).

=> Tuple
 - Tuple is immutable collection of items.
 - Tuple is is defined by using () brackets.
 - Faster and more memory effecient because its immutable

=> List
 - List is mutable collection of items.
 - List is defined by using [] brackets.
 - Slower than tuple because its mutable so its contains more memory space.
