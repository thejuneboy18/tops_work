# Q.1 - ï‚· What is List? How will you reverse a list?

# Ans. -  List is a collection data structure that allows you to store an ordered 
# sequence of elements. The elements can be of any type (integers, strings, objects, etc.), 
# and lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation.

# Example

list_a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

list_a.reverse()
print(list_a)
