# Q-61 - How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some
# built-in exception classes: 

""""
A try-except block in Python can have multiple except statements to handle 
different exceptions. You can have as many except clauses as needed to catch 
various exceptions, either specifically or by using a more general approach.

Some built-in exception classes in Python include:
1)ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.
2)TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
3)IndexError: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range. 
4)KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
5)FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
