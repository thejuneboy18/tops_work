# Q14. What are negative indexes and why are they used

# Ans - Negative indexes in Python allow accessing elements from the end of a list, tuple, or string. For example,
#  -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second-to-last, and so on. They're used for convenience and readability 
# when you need to access elements relative to the sequence's end.
